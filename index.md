### Hey guys,

My name is Claudio.

I really don't know what to say about myself that would mean something to you.

My family and friends give more meaning to my life.

Always trying to understand the world, and never reaching it out.

Always trying to understand myself, and getting better each day.

Someday we will meet life outside our planet, but before I guess we'll learn to do telepathy.

Meanwhile, I'm learning random stuff.
